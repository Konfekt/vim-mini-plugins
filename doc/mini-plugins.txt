INTRODUCTION                                                    *mini-plugins*
==============================================================================

This is a collection of small plugins that I made to take care of simple
tasks. They're small and I don't want to create individual repos for them.
Each of them resides in a single file, they're not |autoload|ed on purpose, so
that if you want you can just take the ones you like and put them in
a directory in your |runtimepath|, such as
>
    ~/.vim/pack/basic/start/vim-mini-plugins/plugin
<
or
>
    ~/.vim/plugin
<
or
>
    ~/.vim/after/plugin
<
etc.

With the same mindset, the plugins have very little configuration options (or
none at all). A big plus for me.




USAGE                                                     *mini-plugins-usage*
==============================================================================

`Caveat`: since I consider them as an extension to my default vimrc, mappings
are enabled by default, and reflect my personal preferences. You can still
disable them with a setting and use the plugs, if you don't like them. Or you
can modify the source and set them from there. I don't think these plugins
will need major updates.

You can disable the ones you don't want to load by adding
>
    let g:loaded_{PLUGIN_NAME} = 1
<




PLUGINS LIST                                               *mini-plugins-list*
==============================================================================

Here follows a short description of each of them and the link to their |help|
file:


|buffer_history.vim|

  Maintain a buffer history per window, based on the `vim-buffer-history`
  plugin by Dhruva Sagar. It supports popup window in both vim and nvim.

                             https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-buffer-history


|marksigns.vim|

  An uncomplicated alternative to `vim-signature`. It only handles lowercase
  and uppercase marks, but it's bug-free as far as I can see. It won't mess
  with `viminfo/shada` files and is optimized with timers.

                                      https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature


|ctrlg.vim|

  A better looking and more informative replacement for the built-in |CTRL-G|
  mapping.


|cwordhi.vim|

  Underline the other occurrences of the word under cursor.


|tree.vim|

  A wrapper for the `tree` executable that works as file browser that shows
  the directories structure. I don't use it that much but it's cool to have
  sometimes. Generally working on UNIX-like systems only.


|noinchlsearch.vim|

  Disable new vim/nvim automatic |hlsearch| on all matches. It is a relatively
  new vim feature that I don't like and it's impossible to get the old
  behaviour otherwise. In vim (but currently not in nvim), by default it still
  works for `ex` commands (only `/?` searches are disabled).
  You can also toggle it with a mapping inside the command line.


|mru.vim|

  Browse recently accessed files with |fzf|. It is based on the similar plugin
  by Yegappan Lakshmanan.
                                               https://github.com/yegappan/mru


|conceal.vim|

  Make invisible some pattern in the buffer.


|web.vim|

  Commands to open urls and search/translate stuff on the web.


|move_by_indent.vim|

  Mappings to move by indent level.
